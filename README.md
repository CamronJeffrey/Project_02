# this is an updated version of my pervious Bank_Management Project. I have added more functions that'll allow the user to store multiple accounts and also display them under a admin panel that I added. This project also turns the output into both a binary file and a text file once the program is fully ran. 
here is the video showcasing the project -> https://youtu.be/offtPqahhYY
